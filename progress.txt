# done with the question card 
# added map function on the card component that takes quiz data as props
# also added a handlenext function to keeps track of the index value and increment the index value on clicking the next button to get next question

GOALS : 1# user clicks option , the option turns yellow theme  (DONE)
        2# when user clicks submit button , if correct option , then turn yellow theme to green theme (having issue with carrying the correct state)
        3# if  user clicks wrong option and submits answer , then turn yellow theme to red and turn the right option to green theme (having issue)

                 let btnCls = "border w-[330px] h-[50px] m-1 cursor-pointer"  //define a btn class like this , much easier to implement with conditions
